Airlines-Reservation-Management-System

I have developed a Database Management System (DBMS) project as part of an assignment from my college. 
The primary function of this project is to enable a customer to book airline tickets. It will allow the customer to make bookings/search for flights 
through different ways such as by choosing the convenient source and destination places or by favourable dates. The Tools used for building this website
are: 1]Front end: HTML,CSS and J.S
     2]Back end: Node and Express js
     3]DataBase: SQL
While building this project i came across various challenges that has helped me to learn new things and leveling up my skills.
